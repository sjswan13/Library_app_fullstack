Online Library Front-End Development

This project showcases the development of a front-end interface for an online library designed for public use. The front-end was built using React and interacts with a RESTful API that was originally provided as part of a Fullstack Academy course. However, access to the API is restricted, making this project a demonstration of front-end development skills.

Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to build a responsive, user-friendly front-end application for an online library. The application was designed to allow users to search, browse, and access a variety of books and resources. Although the API integration is demonstrated, the API itself is proprietary and access is restricted, meaning the full functionality of the application cannot be replicated without appropriate credentials.

Project Details:

-Forked From: Fullstack Academy starter code
-API Provider: Fullstack Academy (proprietary access)
-Deployment: The completed application is deployed and can be accessed here: https://marvelous-sprinkles-854e7b.netlify.app

Tech Stack:

-React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-React Router: For client-side routing and navigation
-Axios or Fetch API: For handling HTTP requests (demonstration only)
-CSS/SCSS: For styling the application
-Netlify: For deployment

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Git

Installation:
Fork and Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-library-frontend.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd online-library-frontend

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

Features:

-Responsive Design
-Search Functionality: Demonstrates how users could search for books by various criteria if the API were accessible.
-Book Details: A mock-up of what detailed views of each book, including descriptions, authors, and availability, would look like.
-User Authentication: The front-end demonstrates the structure and flow for secure login and registration.
-Book Reservations: The front-end shows how users could reserve or check out books directly from the interface.

Deployment:

The application has been deployed with Nelify and is accessible here: https://marvelous-sprinkles-854e7b.netlify.app
